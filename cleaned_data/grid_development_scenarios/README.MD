All files are ";" separated csv files.

### Details on German governments grid development scenarios 2037/45 (cleaned_data/grid_development_scenarios)

### 1. Power generation in megawatts

Various details on power generation in megawatts, e.g. power generation in wind, solar, ...

The two most important files in this folder:
- power_generation_all_sources_installed power [GW].csv - It describes the installed power capacity of all sources in Germany
- power_generation_renewables_generation[TWh].csv - It describes the total energy generated by the installed renewable sources in Germany

The reamining power_generation_*_asumptions.csv files contain assumptions about the renewable energy resources.

### 2. Energy consumption in Terawatthours [TWh]

Files start with energy_consumption_*.csv

### 2.1. Net and Gross energy demand [TWh]

Total energy consumption in Germany is broken down into net and gross (incl. grid losses and power plant self consumption, etc.)

Files start with energy_consumption_Net and Gross energy demand [TWh]_.csv

### 2.2. Net electricity demand [TWh]

Various details on net electricity demand, e.g., non-industrial energy demand, industrial energy demand, appliance consumption in households (HH) and Commerce, Trade and Services (CTS)

Files start with energy_consumption_net_electricity_*.csv

### 2.3. Gross electricity demand [TWh]

Various details on gross electricity demand, e.g., grid losses

Files start with energy_consumption_gross_electricity_*.csv

### 3. Sector coupling

Various details on sector coupling in Germany, e.g. amount of ecars and general transportation KPIs as well heatpumps, electrolysis and power_to_heat

Files start with sector_coupling_*.csv

### 4. Storage Flexibility

Various details on installed power of solar and utility grad batteries as well as demand side managment^
